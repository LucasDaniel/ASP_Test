# ASP_Test

System created for the company alter solutions.
Below is an explanation of how to run the system and use it.

## Installation

Let's use xampp to access the database in a simpler way, to download it use the link

[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html)

After installing xampp run it

Create a .sql file with the following code

```python
SET SQL_MODE = "NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO";
START TRANSACTION;
SET time_zone = "+00:00";

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `test` 
DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;
USE `test`;

CREATE TABLE `login` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `firstName` text NOT NULL,
  `lastName` text NOT NULL,
  `email` text NOT NULL,
  `password` text NOT NULL,
  `age` int(3) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

ALTER TABLE `login`
  ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`);

ALTER TABLE `login`
  MODIFY `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, AUTO_INCREMENT=11;
COMMIT;
```

Open the browser and go to the url localhost/phpmyadmin,
look for the import button, go to browse file and get your .sql file 
that we created just now. Run then.

To run the system from the command line we will use the visual studio code, 
you can download it from the link below

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Make a clone of the system in your preferred folder and open it in terminal

Next we will install the dependencies for the system. 
First let's install composer

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
